# Jack-Bennett Full Stack Frameworks Milestone Project

We, just like you, are always striving to be better everyday and we are always pushing for the next amazing opportunity. We live by the motto to always do more and that's something we hope we you can live by with us.

To always do more is a broad term. To do more does not simply mean spending hours, or even days working on something that will provide minimum value. To do more means you are being more efficient with your time, therefore getting more done. That's where we come in.

# Features



# Database

I decided to use Postgres as the database for this project, which is built into the Django framework. Postgres can be easily accessed and updated by simply using the Django admin panel. This reason alone made it the viable choice over other databases such as MongoDB, as it was easily accessible and was within the framework I was using.
